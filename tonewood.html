      <h3>About Us/h3>
      <div class="intro-text">
        <p>
          Premium tonewood trees grow slowly in high-altitude regions with short growing seasons, resulting in tight, even grain patterns ideal for musical instruments. Our tonewoods are carefully selected, naturally aged, and dried to perfection.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          We supply high-quality tonewoods for a wide variety of musical instruments, including bowed instruments like violins and violas, as well as fretted instruments such as guitars and mandolins. All our tonewoods are naturally seasoned to Master Grade standards with a precise 6% moisture content.

      <h3>From Tree to Soundboard</h3>
      <div class="intro-text">
        <p>
          The finest tonewood comes from high-altitude mountain regions where cold climates and short growing seasons produce spruce trees with tight, regular annual ring growth. European spruce (Picea abies) has proven itself throughout centuries of instrument making as the premier choice for its exceptional tonal characteristics.
        </p>
        <p>
          The wood has to slow-grown, light in weight and yet exhibit a high degree of stiffness. European spruce meets these requirements. Favorable damping qualities, an optimal stiffness to weight ratio, and internal friction are the criteria most sought after in good tonewood.
        </p>
        <p>We execute every step in the production of tonewood:</p>
        <div class="tonewood-features">
          <ul>
            <li>Selection of the best mountain spruce</li>
            <li>Selective logging at the right time</li>
            <li>Transport of felled trees</li>
            <li>Milling of quartersawn wood for soundboards</li>
            <li>Hand-split billets and further processing of soundboards</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          The selection of spruce for tonewood requires extensive experience, knowledge of the characteristics of wood, and competence in logging. As a rule we only use trees with an average diameter of at least 45 centimeters, having reached an age of 200 to 250 years. At this point these trees have reached their maximum age. The harvesting of wood takes place exclusively in the winter months. Timing is of the utmost importance, with felling preceding the new moon.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of Tops and quartersawn wood (for soundboards) is air-driedâ€”just as it was before the Industrial Age. highly qualified and motivated co-workers and a sensible level of mechanization guarantee both quality and efficiency.

      <h3>Quality Standards and Selection</h3>
      <div class="intro-text">
        <p>
          Scientific research has shown that the best tonewood comes from trees growing at high elevations above 1000 meters, particularly on northern slopes where specific soil conditions and climate create ideal growing conditions. These environmental factors produce wood with exceptional tonal qualities.
        </p>
        <p>
          The finest trees are found in areas where nutrient-poor soil and cool climates promote slow, controlled growth. These conditions result in trees with narrow crowns and smaller branches, producing wood that's ideal for instrument making. The wood often displays distinctive characteristics like fine waves in the annual ring growth (known as "bearclaw").
        </p>
        <p>
          Our rigorous quality control process includes careful monitoring of moisture content and thorough testing of wood properties. Through extensive research and testing, we've confirmed that our selected woods exhibit optimal characteristics for musical instrument construction, including:

          <ul>
            <li>Consistent and controlled moisture loss during drying</li>
            <li>Exceptional stability and minimal shrinkage</li>
            <li>Optimal weight-to-strength ratio</li>
            <li>Superior resistance to moisture absorption</li>
            <li>Excellent acoustic properties</li>

      <h3>Moon Wood and Traditional Harvesting</h3>
      <div class="intro-text">
        <p>
          Moon wood refers to timber harvested during specific lunar phases, following traditional practices that have been observed for centuries. This method is believed to enhance the wood's natural properties and characteristics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Traditional woodcraft has long recognized the connection between lunar cycles and wood quality. Trees harvested during specific moon phases are said to exhibit superior properties for musical instrument construction.
        </p>
        <h4>Scientific Understanding of Lunar Influence</h4>
        <p>
          Research has shown that wood properties vary depending on harvest timing in relation to lunar cycles. Studies have examined factors such as moisture content, dimensional stability, and density, revealing interesting correlations between moon phases and wood characteristics.
        </p>
        <div class="tonewood-features">
          <ul>
            <li>Measurable differences in wood properties based on harvest timing</li>
            <li>Influence on moisture content and dimensional stability</li>
            <li>Integration of traditional methods with modern wood selection</li>
            <li>Careful timing of harvest during optimal lunar phases</li>

      <h3>General Features and Characteristics of Tonewood</h3>
      <p>The highest criteria for wood are used for the building of musical instruments:</p>
      <div class="tonewood-features">
        <ul>
          <li>Trunk wood free of any knots</li>
          <li>Straight grain (free of twists)</li>
          <li>Homogeneous wood (no tension wood)</li>
          <li>A uniform structure with tight annual rings ranging from 1-2 (3) mm</li>
          <li>Low ratio of latewood (less than 20-30% of the total growth ring.) This assures a light coloration of the wood</li>
          <li>Light in weight (a low or middle specific weight under 0.450g/cm3) without being soft</li>
          <li>Stiffness: a high deformation resistance (elasticity model) very high in relation to weight</li>
          <li>Sound velocity in high relation to weight and at the same time a high degree of damping</li>
          <li>Low resin content, no pitch pockets</li>
          <li>Uniform in appearance (no color variation)</li>
          <li>Sufficent dimensions for quartersawing (trees with a diameter of more than 50 cm)</li>
          <li>If possible, a special sheen</li>
          <li>If possible, smooth, not brittle plane shavings</li>
        </ul>
