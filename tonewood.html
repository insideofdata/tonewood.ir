      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <div class="intro-text">
        <p>
          Premium tonewood trees grow slowly in high-altitude regions with short growing seasons, resulting in tight,
          even grain patterns ideal for musical instruments. Our tonewoods are carefully selected, naturally aged, and
          dried to perfection.
        </p>
        <p>
          We supply high-quality tonewoods for a wide variety of musical instruments, including bowed instruments like
          violins and violas, as well as fretted instruments such as guitars and mandolins. All our tonewoods are
          naturally seasoned to Master Grade standards with a precise 6% moisture content.

      <h3>Quality Standards and Selection</h3>
      <div class="intro-text">
        <p>
          Scientific research has shown that the best tonewood comes from trees growing at high elevations above 1000
          meters, particularly on northern slopes where specific soil conditions and climate create ideal growing
          conditions. These environmental factors produce wood with exceptional tonal qualities.
        </p>
        <p>
          The finest trees are found in areas where nutrient-poor soil and cool climates promote slow, controlled
          growth. These conditions result in trees with narrow crowns and smaller branches, producing wood that's ideal
          for instrument making. The wood often displays distinctive characteristics like fine waves in the annual ring
          growth (known as "bearclaw").
        </p>
        <p>
          Our rigorous quality control process includes careful monitoring of moisture content and thorough testing of
          wood properties. Through extensive research and testing, we've confirmed that our selected woods exhibit
          optimal characteristics for musical instrument construction, including:

      <h3>Moon Wood and Traditional Harvesting</h3>
      <div class="intro-text">
        <p>
          Moon wood refers to timber harvested during specific lunar phases, following traditional practices that have
          been observed for centuries. This method is believed to enhance the wood's natural properties and
          characteristics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Traditional woodcraft has long recognized the connection between lunar cycles and wood quality. Trees
          harvested during specific moon phases are said to exhibit superior properties for musical instrument
          construction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Research has shown that wood properties vary depending on harvest timing in relation to lunar cycles. Studies
          have examined factors such as moisture content, dimensional stability, and density, revealing interesting
          correlations between moon phases and wood characteristics.

            <li>Measurable differences in wood properties based on harvest timing</li>
            <li>Influence on moisture content and dimensional stability</li>
            <li>Integration of traditional methods with modern wood selection</li>
            <li>Careful timing of harvest during optimal lunar phases</li>

      <h3>General Features and Characteristics of Tonewood</h3>
      <p>The highest criteria for wood are used for the building of musical instruments:</p>
      <div class="tonewood-features">
        <ul>
          <li>Trunk wood free of any knots</li>
          <li>Straight grain (free of twists)</li>
          <li>Homogeneous wood (no tension wood)</li>
          <li>A uniform structure with tight annual rings ranging from 1-2 (3) mm</li>
          <li>Low ratio of latewood (less than 20-30% of the total growth ring.) This assures a light coloration of the
            wood</li>
          <li>Light in weight (a low or middle specific weight under 0.450g/cm3) without being soft</li>
          <li>Stiffness: a high deformation resistance (elasticity model) very high in relation to weight</li>
          <li>Sound velocity in high relation to weight and at the same time a high degree of damping</li>
          <li>Low resin content, no pitch pockets</li>
          <li>Uniform in appearance (no color variation)</li>
          <li>Sufficent dimensions for quartersawing (trees with a diameter of more than 50 cm)</li>
          <li>If possible, a special sheen</li>
          <li>If possible, smooth, not brittle plane shavings</li>
        </ul>
